## The display module for kiosk

This project is serving for the touch-display module of the **kiosk**. We've found tablets from China, 
which are cheaper than the touch-displays, so currently we are using a tablet for the display. This gives us the
opportunity to make the display interface to be rendered in browser and shown in full-screen mode or as an android
application.
